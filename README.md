# stonepoem
Part of an artwork, a node.js script that uses chat-gtp 3.5 to display a poem with p5.js

“Could you create a poem that a robot would write to a stone ? The poem would be inspired by the guilt, fear and sadness that the robot feels about the environmental crisis. It would be an apology motivated by empathy and would highlight the mineral carracter of both parties.” 

The technologies at the heart of our lives are inherently material, composed of numerous minerals and metals. Thus, over the course of its life cycle, a television produces more than 30 times its weight in waste. A rock weighing 500kg and a screen with an equivalent environmental impact are brought together in space so that every day, at sunrise, the robot composes and broadcasts a poem to the rock. Created with the help of artificial intelligence (Chat-Gpt), the poems generated by the robot are the result of collaboration between the artist and the AI.

Usage:

* If you want to use this code you need to install node and then cors, dotenv, express, openai, socket.io and suncalc if you want to use the sunrise data.
* You also need to create a .env file at the root of stonepoem-main with export OPENAI_API_KEY='yourapikey' inside.

  It has been tested and works locally on a Raspberry Pi 4 with Raspbian v11, to display the http://localhost:3000/ page full screen simply do f11 and then Cltr+R to refresh so that the canvas adjusts
